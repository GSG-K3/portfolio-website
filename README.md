# portfolio-website 
Team Names: Rahaf , Karmel , Tasneem , Hussien
This is our  offical project at GSG-K3 Academy. project period: only 2 days.
we assumed that we have a comoany which called makergroup its a web development company established 2011, consist of 50 employees,worked with over 200 projects .....
Our website describe the vision and goals of our company.
so we first draw a draft image of our website at notebook, we picked the logo and each one started his own job after we divided the project, our work flow went into four steps:
first step karmel and tasneem worked at the main section 
second step rahaf worked at ourteam section 
third step hussien worked at contact/footer section 
the last step we worked together.
website contains only one single main page and through this page you will find a navbar scrolled over the same page: home ,contact about us ,teams......Basically we programmed with html and css. went through accessibility tools.
we tried to upload our files through Terminal commands so each one uploaded his own project after he/she finished it, we megred the sections together and solved the conflicts.

Thats all 
Hope you enjoed our website deisgn
Goodluck for the next step
